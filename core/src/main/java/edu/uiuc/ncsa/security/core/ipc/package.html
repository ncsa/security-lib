    <title>Inter-process communications utilities</title>
</head>
<body>

This package consists of utilities (a bean and listener interfaces) for monitoring interprocess
communications. For instance, if a servlet needs to start a thread, how can that thread communicate with
others? The solution offered here is to register listeners to a bean. The bean just shares state and listens
for events to dictate its actions.
