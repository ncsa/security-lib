# Building the library

To build the library, check it out to a location. Set this in the
build.sh file, in the SVN_ROOT variable,  along with pointing to your 
Java distro in JAVA_HOME. These are the only two things you need
to set. 

Note that Java
should be Java 11 (recommended) or perhaps up to Java 15. Higher or lower will not work.
