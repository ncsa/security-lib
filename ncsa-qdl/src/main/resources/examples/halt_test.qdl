/*
   This is a file to test the halt() function. It has several halts in it which you can then resume and run until
   the next one. It is intended to be a mini-tutorial in how this operates. You should issue

   )si --help

   for more information.

   Use. Create a buffer, then run it in the workspace. Everytime it hits a halt call, it will stop and the message
   in the state indicator will update. You can then set the default pid to whatever this is and resume.
