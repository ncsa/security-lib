This is scrapbook of things That I would like to consider for QDL that are not fully formed
but should be captured someplace.

- Workspace Library mangement
    Be able to designate a command to run on load/reload
    Have a run_on_load property in WS that is the name of a command?
    Or have a designated method like on_boot() or init() that is always run? Gives another keyword
    basically in QDL.

- Short circuit conditionals so we don't have to keep nesting them.
  E.g.

  if[A!=null && size(A) != 0][...];

  if A is undefined, size(A) is never checked rather than throwing an exception.
  Hard bit is making sure this works in nested conditionals
  E.g.

  if[B<0 && !(a == null || size(a) ==0)][...];
  issues are
  * a == null fails because a is undefined. Did we want to change that?
       ** NO. Make them set the value first.
  * each logical operator is a separate call (doDyadEqualsOperator etc.) so may need to
  catch things at a higher level. Maybe throw a BadBooleanException or some such?
  This is using exceptions in place of listeners which might be ok.
