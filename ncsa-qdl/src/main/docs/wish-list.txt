This is scrapbook of things That I would like to consider for QDL that are not fully formed
but should be captured someplace.

The current parser definitions require that expression stems components be either simple variables,
functions or ( expression). So
f(n).3 fails
f(n).(3) works
This is because parsing would tokenize
a.0
as the simple variable "a" followed by the decimal ".0" and then blow up. The parser tries to match
in this way automatically. The way to fix this is with
predicates in the grammar that plays with the input stream and tokens found up to this point. This
is an entire chapter in the Antlr book, so it needs some serious study.

For now, it all works, so the day to parser get rewritten with predicates just means parentheses
can get dropped.

- Workspace Library mangement
    Be able to designate a command to run on load/reload
    Have a run_on_load property in WS that is the name of a command?
    Or have a designated method like on_boot() or init() that is always run? Gives another keyword
    basically in QDL. :(
