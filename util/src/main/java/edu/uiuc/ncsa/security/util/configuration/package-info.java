/**
 * Utilities for working with configurations. This also supports templates, which means that
 * in text, terms in ${...} will be replaced with other values. In the CLI, this is the
 * basis for environment support. In the case of the mail utilities, you can create a template
 * message with entries that are replaced when the message is sent. There are a lot of uses for
 * templates.
