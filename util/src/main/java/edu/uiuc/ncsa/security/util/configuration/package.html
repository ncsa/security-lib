<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>This package collects the high-level configuration abstraction used in the Security packages. It consists of
    a configuration which has components. These components will inject their property values into beans, which
    then allows applications to be independent of configuration. There are several possible ways to configure
    a system, e.g., reading in properties from a servlet context, having them stored in a database or even in an
    serialized in an RDF file. Applications should be aware of none of these. </p>

<h3>Use</h3>
Applications should use a <a href="ConfigurationStore.java">configuration store</a> to manage a collection
of configurations. Each configuration has a unique identifier that is a URI and so may be retrieved. Generally,
a configuration has a complete set of components. A <a href="ConfigurationStoreFactory.java">configuration store
    factory</a>
retrieves the store of configurations. Each component has an <code>inject</code> method which is called with a bean
as the argument. It is best to read the documentation in the
<a href="ConfigurationComponent.java">configuration component</a> for details. At this point the components must be
aware of their targets and inject properties into them. The reason for this as opposed to some other mechanism is
that generic beans may be configured this way (vs. requiring them to e.g., implement some interface).
