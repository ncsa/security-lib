            <![CDATA[Invocation option for the configuration file. This requires the full path to the configuration file.
You can also use the long version of -configFile.

E.g.
java -jar cli.jar -cfg /path/to/cfg.xml -name default

would load the configuration file, cfg.xml, find the configuration named "default" and set that
as the current configuration.

Note that if the named configuration or file cannot be found, a message is printed and the
system loads with no configuration.
