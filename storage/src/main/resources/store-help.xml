    <![CDATA[Results are static sets of output from a search that are named and may be
queried separately.
Creation and management
-----------------------
You create them in searches using the -rs name flag, e.g.

admins> search >admin_id -r .*caltech.* -rs ligo

would search (in the admins store) the property name admin_id for any entry including the string "calttech"
and stash the results in a result set named "ligo". You may now use the rs command
to navigate this result set. You may have as many result sets as you like.

You may also restrict the results to a subset of properties with the -attr flag.

admins> search >admin_id -attr [allow_qdl,name] -r .*caltech.* -rs qdl_check

would search on the admin_id and the result set would have the two properties
listed. Showing the result set then only has those.

admins>rs list foo
  foo: 56 entries,  fields=[allow_qdl, name]

admins> rs show [11,17] foo
    11. true  | Test admin client caltech-IGWN
    12. true  | Test admin client caltech/LIGO
    13. false | IGWN admin for VIRGO 1
    14. true  | IGWN admin for VIRGO 2
    15. true  | LIGO issuer UW Milwaukee
    16. true  | LIGO issuer UW Madison

shows the subset from index 11 in the list up to but not including index 17 (or
the end of the list, whichever comes first).

The -show flag also allows for displaying subsets but be warned that if you searched for
a subset of properties, then only those are available. You may restrict to a subset of those,
but cannot display properties you do not have.

Result sets as arguments
------------------------
Most commands allow you to specify a result set or subset as an argument. The basic syntax is
-rs name (-- | -range) (list | integer)
where name is the name and the range is either a single integer giving the index in the set or a
list of them. Be aware that some commands only accept a single object (e.g. changing and id, which
would give multiple objects the same id.)

Lists
-----
Lists are actually valid QDL, though are restricted to being un-nested. You could
therefore list the elements of a result set named X from 1 through 6 as

rs show -range [1;7] X

Negative indices are allowed, which reference element from the end of the set

rs show -range -1 X

references the last element of the set X.

Similarly you could do a mass update as

update >debug_on -value false -rs X

would set the debug_on flag to false for every element in X

Caveat: Result sets are static! This means that an update will update the stored
        objects that the result set references. If you alter the stored object(s)
        you will need to refresh your result set accordingly.
