/**
 * Interface for stores. This models a specific case, where there is a primary key, so that this is
 * logically also a map. Each row corresponds to (usually) one java object. What the map interface
 * lacks is concepts for CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) and this interface adds those.
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 * A very large number of practical database programming issues fall into this case and
 * the interfaces and basic classes in this package make setting up and managing them
 * extremely simple.
