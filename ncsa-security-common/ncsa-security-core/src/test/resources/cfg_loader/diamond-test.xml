<!--
     The diamond problem is a famous one in multiple inheritance. If A and B inherit from C
     (so each has its own overrides) , and D inherits from them, which to use?
     Our solution is positional. Specifying "B C" then B has preference to C.

<config>
    <service name="A" overrides="C"/>  <!-- A C -->
    <service name="B" overrides="C"/>  <!-- B C -->
    <service name="C"/>
    <service name="D" overrides="A B "/> <!-- D A B C -->
    <service name="E" overrides="B A "/> <!-- E B A C -->
</config>
