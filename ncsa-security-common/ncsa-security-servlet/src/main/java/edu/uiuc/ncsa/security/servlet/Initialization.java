/**
 * The reason this class exists is because of Java single-inheritence. A top-level servlet
 * class has an init() method that is called. However, if there are many subclasses of this
 * it can be very hard to change their initialization without over-riding several classes
 * or doing something very odd, such as extending a single subclass to do nothing but over-ride
 * its parent then putting in machinery to prevent the parent from running its init method. Hardly
 * ideal.This interface decouples initialization from the servlet. The {@link Bootstrapper}
 * is tasked with making the correct instance of this class which is then injected into the
 * servlet statically on boot. This in turn is called in the servlet init method.
 * <br/><br/>This solves issue OAUTH-112.
